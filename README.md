🚀 CIFAR-10 Image Classification using Flask and OpenCV
❓❓ Project Description:
The project is an image classification system based on deep learning, utilizing a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify CIFAR-10 dataset images into one of 10 categories:

✈️ Airplane

🚗 Automobile

🐦 Bird

🐱 Cat

🦌 Deer

🐶 Dog

🐸 Frog

🐎 Horse

🚢 Ship

🚚 Truck

The model is hosted with Flask, a lightweight Python web framework, and uses OpenCV to capture real-time images through the webcam for classification.

❗❗ Key Features:
✅ Deep Learning Model:

A CNN model trained on the CIFAR-10 dataset to identify objects from 10 classes.

The model has competitive accuracy with minimal overfitting.

✅ Real-Time Image Classification:

Uses OpenCV to read from the webcam and capture live images.

The captured image is preprocessed, resized, and normalized before passing it through the model.

The system displays the predicted label and confidence score in real time.

✅ Web Interface:

Developed with Flask, offering a user-friendly web application to initiate the webcam stream and classify images.

Displays the captured image and the predicted label on the web page.

⚙️⚙️ Tech Stack Used:

🐍 Python: For building the backend and model inference.

🌐 Flask: For serving the web application.

📷 OpenCV: For capturing real-time webcam images.

🔥 TensorFlow/Keras: For loading the deep learning model and making predictions.

🎨 HTML/CSS: For designing the front-end interface.

🔧🔧 How It Works:
🛠️ Model Training:

The CNN model is trained on the CIFAR-10 dataset and saved as cifar10_model.h5.

🚀 Flask Deployment:

The saved model is loaded into the Flask application.

📸 Real-Time Prediction:

The web application opens a webcam feed, takes a snapshot, preprocesses it, and predicts the class label.

🖥️ Display:

The application shows the image and the predicted class with confidence level.

🚀🚀 Future Improvements:

🛠️ Implement additional image preprocessing techniques to enhance accuracy.

🎯 Improve the user interface using Bootstrap or Tailwind for better styling.

📊 Add a confidence visualization in the form of a probability bar chart.

🔄 Add data augmentation during training to prevent overfitting.

✅ This project demonstrates the full pipeline of model training, deployment, and real-time image classification, making it an excellent example of applying deep learning in a real-world web-based application. 🚀🎉
